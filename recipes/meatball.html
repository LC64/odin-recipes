    <h3>The Spicy Meatball You Crave</h3>
    <p>
      These meatballs are easy to make and they taste delicous, but watchout
      because they are spicy.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
      <li>1/2 medium yellow onion, cut into chunks</li>
      <li>1½ pounds ground beef (80/20 blend)</li>
      <li>1/2 cup whole milk</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 cup Italian-style breadcrumbs</li>
      <li>1/3 cup parsley, finely chopped</li>
      <li>1/4 cup grated Parmigiano Reggiano</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>Vegetable oil, for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 375°F and line a sheet pan with aluminum foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a mini food processor, puree the garlic and onion, scraping down
        the sides as needed. A few little chunks are fine, but I prefer a
        smoother texture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer the onion and garlic mixture to a large bowl. Add the ground
        beef, milk, eggs, breadcrumbs, parsley, pecorino, Parmigiano Reggiano,
        salt and pepper. Using your hands, gently mix until all ingredients are
        combined. Do not mash or overmix the mixture. Refrigerate for 30 to 60
        minutes to allow breadcrumbs to hydrate.
      </li>
      <li>
        To fry the meatballs, fill a large, high-sided skillet with 1-inch of
        vegetable oil, and heat to 350°F. Meanwhile, using a ¼-cup scoop, scoop
        out and portion to meat into even balls. Gently roll each portion into a
        ball, being sure not to pack the meat too tightly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fry the meatballs in batches, cooking each side until deep brown, about
        one to two minutes per side. Transfer the meatballs to the foil-lined
        sheet pan. Bake to an internal temperature of 165°F, about 12 to 15
        minutes. Alternatively, you can finish cooking the meatballs by
        simmering them marinara sauce for 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add something spicy, because this wasn't actually a recipe for spicy
        meatballs.
      </li>
      <li>Serve with a good, homemade tomato sauce and your favorite pasta.</li>
    </ol>
