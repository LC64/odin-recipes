    <h4>The Spicy Meatball You Crave</h4>
    <p>
      These meatballs are easy to make and they taste delicous, but watchout
      because they are spicy.
    </p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <div class="container">
      <ul>
        <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1/2 medium yellow onion, cut into chunks</li>
        <li>1½ pounds ground beef (80/20 blend)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup Italian-style breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>1/3 cup parsley, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated Parmigiano Reggiano</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil, for frying</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <div class="container">
      <ol class="list">
        <li>
          Preheat the oven to 375°F and line a sheet pan with aluminum foil.
        </li>
        <li>
          Using a mini food processor, puree the garlic and onion, scraping down
          the sides as needed. A few little chunks are fine, but I prefer a
          smoother texture.
        </li>
        <li>
          Transfer the onion and garlic mixture to a large bowl. Add the ground
          beef, milk, eggs, breadcrumbs, parsley, pecorino, Parmigiano Reggiano,
          salt and pepper. Using your hands, gently mix until all ingredients
          are combined. Do not mash or overmix the mixture. Refrigerate for 30
          to 60 minutes to allow breadcrumbs to hydrate.
        </li>
        <li>
          To fry the meatballs, fill a large, high-sided skillet with 1-inch of
          vegetable oil, and heat to 350°F. Meanwhile, using a ¼-cup scoop,
          scoop out and portion to meat into even balls. Gently roll each
          portion into a ball, being sure not to pack the meat too tightly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fry the meatballs in batches, cooking each side until deep brown,
          about one to two minutes per side. Transfer the meatballs to the
          foil-lined sheet pan. Bake to an internal temperature of 165°F, about
          12 to 15 minutes. Alternatively, you can finish cooking the meatballs
          by simmering them marinara sauce for 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add something spicy, because this wasn't actually a recipe for spicy
          meatballs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Serve with a good, homemade tomato sauce and your favorite pasta.
        </li>
      </ol>
